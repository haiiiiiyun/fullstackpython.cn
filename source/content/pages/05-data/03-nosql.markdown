# NoSQL Data Stores
Relational databases store the vast majority of web application 
persistent data. However, there are several alternative classifications of 
storage representations.

1. Key-value pair
1. Document-oriented
1. Column-family table
1. Graph

These persistent data storage representations are commonly used to augment,
rather than completely replace, relational databases. The underlying 
persistence type used by the NoSQL database often gives it different
performance characteristics than a relational database, with better results
on some types of read/writes and worse performance on others.


## Key-value Pair
Key-value pair data stores are based
on [hash map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) data structures.


### Key-value pair data stores
* [Redis](http://redis.io/) is an open source in-memory key-value pair data 
  store. Redis is often called "the Swiss Army Knife of web application
  development." It can be used for caching, queuing, and storing session data 
  for faster access than a traditional relational database, among many other
  use cases. [Redis-py](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py) is a solid
  Python client to use with Redis.

* [Memcached](http://www.memcached.org/) is another widely used in-memory
  key-value pair storage system.


### Key-value pair resources
* [What is a key-value store database?](http://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/607/what-is-a-key-value-store-database)
  is a Stack Overflow Q&A that straight on answers this subject.

  based on [security guidelines](http://www.antirez.com/news/96). There is
  also a post where the main author of Redis 
  [cracks its security](http://www.antirez.com/news/96) to show the tradeoffs
  purposely made between ease of use and security in the default settings.


## Document-oriented
A document-oriented database provides a semi-structured representation for
nested data. 


### Document-oriented data stores
* [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) is an open source document-oriented 
  data store with a Binary Object Notation (BSON) storage format that is 
  JSON-style and familiar to web developers. 
  [PyMongo](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/python/) is a
  commonly used client for interfacing with one or more MongoDB 
  instances through Python code. [MongoEngine](http://mongoengine.org/)
  is a Python ORM specifically written for MongoDB that is built on top
  of PyMongo.

* [Riak](http://basho.com/riak/) is an open source distributed data store
  focused on availability, fault tolerance and large scale deployments.

* [Apache CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) is also an open source project
  where the focus is on embracing RESTful-style HTTP access for working with 
  stored JSON data.


### Document-oriented data store resources
* [MongoDB for startups](http://www.optinidus.com/blogs/guide-to-mongodb-for-startups/) 
  is a guide about using non-relational databases in green field environments.

* The creator and maintainers of PyMongo review four decisions they regret
  from building the widely-used Python MongoDB driver.

    1. [MongoReplicaSetClient](http://emptysqua.re/blog/good-idea-at-the-time-pymongo-mongoreplicasetclient/)

* The 
  [Python and MongoDB](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/2/python-and-mongodb) 
  Talk Python to Me podcast has a great interview with the maintainer of the 
  Python driver for MongoDB.


## Column-family table
A the column-family table class of NoSQL data stores builds on the key-value
pair type. Each key-value pair is considered a row in the store while the
column family is similar to a table in the relational database model.


### Column-family table data stores
* Apache [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/)

* Apache [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/)


## Graph
A graph database represents and stores data in three aspects: nodes, edges
and properties. 

A *node* is an entity, such as a person or business. 

An *edge* is the relationship between two entities. For example, an 
edge could represent that a node for a person entity is an employee of a 
business entity. 

A *property* represents information about nodes. For example, an entity 
representing a person could have a property of "female" or "male".


### Graph data stores
* [Neo4j](http://www.neo4j.org/) is one of the most widely used graph 
  databases and runs on the Java Virtual Machine stack.

* [Cayley](https://github.com/google/cayley) is an open source graph data
  store written by Google primarily written in Go.

* [Titan](http://thinkaurelius.github.io/titan/) is a distributed graph
  database built for multi-node clusters.


### Graph data store resources
* [Introduction to Graph Databases](http://www.slideshare.net/maxdemarzi/introduction-to-graph-databases-12735789)

  data store types.


## NoSQL third-party services
* [MongoHQ](http://www.mongohq.com/home) provides MongoDB as a service. It's
  easy to set up with either a standard LAMP stack or on Heroku.


## NoSQL data store resources
* [NoSQL databases: an overview](http://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/nosql-databases-overview)
  explains what NoSQL means, how data is stored differently than in
  relational systems and what the Consistency, Availability and 
  Partition-Tolerance (CAP) Theorem means.

* [CAP Theorem overview](http://natishalom.typepad.com/nati_shaloms_blog/2010/10/nocap.html)
  presents the basic constraints all databases must trade off in operation.

* This post on [What is a NoSQL database? Learn By Writing One in Python](http://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/09/01/what-is-a-nosql-database-learn-by-writing-one-in-python/)
  is a detailed article that breaks the mystique behind what some forms
  of NoSQL databases are doing under the covers.

* The [CAP Theorem series](http://blog.thislongrun.com/2015/03/the-cap-theorem-series.html)
  explains concepts related to NoSQL such as what is ACID compared to CAP, CP 
  versus CA and high availability in large scale deployments.

* [NoSQL Weekly](http://www.nosqlweekly.com/) is a free curated email 
  newsletter that aggregates articles, tutorials, and videos about 
  non-relational data stores.

* [NoSQL comparison](http://kkovacs.eu/cassandra-vs-mongodb-vs-couchdb-vs-redis)
  is a large list of popular, BigTable-based, special purpose, and other
  datastores with attributes and the best use cases for each one.

* Relational databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL have added features in
  more recent versions that mimic some of the capabilities of NoSQL data
  stores. For example, check out this blog post on 
  [using MySQL as a key-value pair store](http://engineering.wix.com/2015/12/10/scaling-to-100m-mysql-is-a-better-nosql/)
  and this post on
  [storing JSON data in PostgreSQL](https://blog.codeship.com/unleash-the-power-of-storing-json-in-postgres/).


## NoSQL data stores learning checklist
1. Understand why NoSQL data stores are better for some use cases than 
   relational databases. In general these benefits are only seen at large 
   scale so they may not be applicable to your web application.

1. Integrate Redis into your project for a speed boost over slower persistent 
   storage. Storing session data in memory is generally much faster than 
   saving that data in a traditional relational database that uses persistent 
   storage. Note that when memory is flushed the data goes away so anything 
   that needs to be persistent must still be backed up to disk on a regular 
   basis.

1. Evaluate other use cases such as storing transient logs in a 
   document-oriented data store such as MongoDB.
